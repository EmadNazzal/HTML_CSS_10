# How to Open/Read this Project

You can access the entire webpage through GitHub pages that allows us to host static website for purposes of testing and demonstration.

> 			   *[Click Here to Access the webpage](https://emadnazzal.github.io/HTML_CSS_10/pages/index.html)*

The project consists of three folders :

 1. Pages folder

	 
		 - Index.html
		 - work.html
		 - about.html
		 -  contact.html
		 - social.html

 - Styles folder
		
		 - main.css
		 - work.css
		 - about.css
		 - contact.css
		 - social.css


 
 - Media folder
		
		 - contains all multimedia for the website such as, pictures, videos, icons, sounds ..etc.

# Important Note

The website works 100% on the GitHub pages hosting service. However, Since all files are organized in **sub-folders**, GitHub can't read the subfolder file. So, it can only **read Root folder**. (Main branch). 

When accessing the website from the link above, **ONLY index.html will work**, because I created a dummy - fake - redirecting html page in the root folder for the main page index.html 

if you wish to access any other page online you can do the following : 

this is the main link **https://emadnazzal.github.io/HTML_CSS_10/pages/index.html**

if you want to access about.html you have to make sure that **HTML_CSS_10** is in the URL.
so, it will be something like this :
https://emadnazzal.github.io/**HTML_CSS_10**/pages/about.html

# Disclaimer

 - The website in not 100% responsive on different monitor sizes.
 - Repetition could have been completely discarded if some interactive code was used (eg. Javascript)
 - Website Fails Google Chrome Accessibility test.
 - Lacks Proper containerization / wrapping.
